##Code execution##
The code provided in sequence_extraction.py allows to extract the aligned 
sequences from a file containing BLAST results and writes them in fasta 
format.
To execute the code, use:
python sequence_extraction.py -input *input file* -output *output file*

##Additional data##

All the identified Terminal Inverted Repeat (TIR) sequences can be found 
in TIR_search_results.txt file.

The dataset showing horizontal transfer of HZTransib can be found in 
aa_horizontal.fasta file.

The dataset of reference tree can be found in 
annotated_both_tir_clean.fasta file.

The dataset containing both complete genes and pseudogenes can be foun in 
annotates_pseudo.fasta file.
 
The guide_tree_dataset.fasta file contains the sequences used for guide 
tree construction.
